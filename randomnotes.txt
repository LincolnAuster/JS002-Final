I guess I want to simulate the pull of water molecules on each other

Oxygen has a partial negative charge, hydrogen has a partial positive charge.

In theory this should be simple, every partial charge will attract each other.

But then I should first be able to simulate the charge of single atoms and how the repel each other

Let's pretend that atoms are just a bunch of electrons. It only cares about valence electrons

Right now, the program needs no notion of molecules as it's only simulating one.

The program takes electrons and distributes theme evenly across a sphere
Actually, I bet if I wrote a blender add on to simulate electron's push away from each other, that would be sssssick.

So that means I need to include:

Positive attractive charge in nucleus
Negative charge from electrons

That SHOULD derive shielding and all the other properties.

So question, Can electron shielding be derived from a simple simulation of electron charges?
